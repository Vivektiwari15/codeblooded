        <p style="margin: 12px;"></p>
        <p style="margin: 12px;">Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is
            designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming
            language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),meaning that compiled Java code
            can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.Java applications are
            typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying
            computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than
            either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code
            modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one
            of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,particularly for
            client–server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.</p>

        <p style="margin: 12px;">Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. It was released in
            May 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation
            Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary
            licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had
            relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java
            Virtual Machine, however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source
            software and used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions.</p>

        <p style="margin: 12px;">James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project
            in June 1991.Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the
            digital cable television industry at the time.The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree
            that stood outside Gosling's office. Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java,
            from Java coffee, a type of coffee from Indonesia.Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that
            system and application programmers would find familiar</p>

        <p style="margin: 12px;">Sun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1996.[26] It
            promised write once, run anywhere (WORA) functionality, providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms.
            Fairly secure and featuring configurable security, it allowed network- and file-access restrictions. Major
            web browsers soon incorporated the ability to run Java applets within web pages, and Java quickly became
            popular. The Java 1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur van Hoff to comply strictly with the Java
            1.0 language specification.With the advent of Java 2 (released initially as J2SE 1.2 in December 1998 –
            1999), new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms. J2EE included
            technologies and APIs for enterprise applications typically run in server environments, while J2ME featured
            APIs optimized for mobile applications. The desktop version was renamed J2SE. In 2006, for marketing
            purposes, Sun renamed new J2 versions as Java EE, Java ME, and Java SE, respectively.</p>
