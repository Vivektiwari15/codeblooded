    <div class="container" style="font-family:'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif, 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif, 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;">
    <p style="margin: 12px;">Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence—perceiving, synthesizing, and inferring information—demonstrated by
        machines, as opposed to intelligence displayed by non-human animals and humans. Example tasks in which this is
        done include speech recognition, computer vision, translation between (natural) languages, as well as other
        mappings of inputs.</p>
        <p style="margin: 12px;">AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by
        YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g.,
        Waymo), generative or creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), automated decision-making, and competing at the
        highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go).</p>
          
        <p style="margin: 12px;">As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the
        definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect.For instance, optical character recognition is
        frequently excluded from things considered to be AI,having become a routine technology.</p>
               
        <p style="margin: 12px;">Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since it has experienced
        several waves of optimism,followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an "AI
        winter"),followed by new approaches, success, and renewed funding. AI research has tried and
        discarded many different approaches, including simulating the brain, modeling human problem solving, formal
        logic, large databases of knowledge, and imitating animal behavior. In the first decades of the 21st century,
        highly mathematical and statistical machine learning has dominated the field, and this technique has proved
        highly successful, helping to solve many challenging problems throughout industry and academia.</p>
           
        <p style="margin: 12px;">The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The
        traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural
        language processing, perception, and the ability to move and manipulate objects.General intelligence (the
        ability to solve an arbitrary problem) is among the field's long-term goals.To solve these problems, AI
        researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques, including search and
        mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics,
        probability, and economics. AI also draws upon computer science, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many
        other fields.</p>
            
        <p style="margin: 12px;">The field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence "can be so precisely described that a machine
        can be made to simulate it".This raised philosophical arguments about the mind and the ethical consequences
        of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence; these issues have previously been explored
        by myth, fiction, and philosophy since antiquity.Computer scientists and philosophers have since suggested
        that AI may become an existential risk to humanity if its rational capacities are not steered towards beneficial
        goals.The term artificial intelligence has also been criticized for overhyping AI's true technological
        capabilities.</p>
